# AI Usage Report – Assignment 1

## Tools Used & Use Cases

For this assignment, I used ChatGPT as a supportive AI development tool.

ChatGPT was mainly used for:
- Clarifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
- Assisting with debugging and improving code structure.
- Suggesting enhancements for layout and interactivity.
- Refining wording to maintain a professional tone in my portfolio.

The core structure, customization, and final implementation decisions were made by me after reviewing and understanding the AI suggestions.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
Using AI helped me:
- Improve code organization and readability.
- Understand JavaScript event handling more clearly.
- Explore better layout practices using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Enhance the professionalism of my written content.

### Challenges
The main challenge was ensuring I fully understood the suggested code before integrating it. I carefully reviewed, tested, and modified the AI-generated suggestions to match my design preferences and assignment requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

Through using AI, I improved my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation and event listeners in JavaScript.
- Form handling without page reload.
- Responsive layout structuring.
- Writing cleaner, well-documented code.

This process strengthened both my technical skills and my ability to critically evaluate AI-generated suggestions.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

AI was used strictly as a learning assistant and guidance tool.  
All code was reviewed, modified, and tested independently to ensure correctness, originality, and academic integrity.

I ensured that I fully understood every part of the implementation before including it in my final submission.
